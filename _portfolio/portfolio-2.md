### Tools: MySQL


### Analysis Process:
<font size=3> 
   1. Import Data <br/>
   2. Read and Explore Data <br/>
   3. Data Analysis <br/>
   5. Find Insights <br/>

**<font size=3> a. Create Tables and Import Data 🔗 </font>**

```sql

    rating_count_ver INT,
    user_rating DECIMAL,
    user_rating_ver DECIMAL,
    ver VARCHAR(255),
    cont_rating VARCHAR(255),
    prime_genre VARCHAR(255),
    sup_devices_num INT,

**<font size=3> c. Average of App Ratings and Paid App Price </font>**
```sql
-- Average of App Ratings and Paid App Price
SELECT ROUND(AVG(user_rating), 1) AS AvgRating,

**<font size=3> b. Check if Apps with more Supporting Languages have Higher Rating </font>**
```sql
-- Check if Apps with more supporting languages have higher rating
SELECT CASE
	   WHEN lang_num < 10 THEN '<10 languages'
	   WHEN lang_num BETWEEN 10 AND 30 THEN '10-30 languages'
	   ELSE '>30 languages'

**<font size=3> c. Check Correlation Between App Screenshot and Rating </font>**
```sql
-- Check if Apps with more supporting languages have higher rating
SELECT CASE
	   WHEN ipadSc_urls_num < 1 THEN 'No Screenshot'
          WHEN ipadSc_urls_num BETWEEN 1 AND 3 THEN '1-3 Screenshot'
          ELSE '4-5 Screenshot'
	END AS ScrnType,

WITH top_app AS(
SELECT prime_genre,
	track_name,
       user_rating,
       rating_count_tot,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY prime_genre ORDER BY user_rating DESC, rating_count_tot DESC) AS tot_r

### <font color='blue'> 4. Finding Insights </font>

<font size=3>
・The new app should set goal for an average rating above 3.8. <br/>
・Paid Apps have better ratings, and the average rating is 4.0. <br/>
・Games and Entertainment genre have high competition.
・The average ratings in Catelog, Medical and Navigation genre are very low.<br/>
・Apps with 4-5 screenshots showed for display and 10-30 languages supporting have better ratings. </font>
